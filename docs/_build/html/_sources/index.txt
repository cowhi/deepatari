Welcome to **deepatari**!
=========================

This is a framework to support the development of algorithms for intelligent
agents in the Atari game playing domain. The idea is to let researcher or
programmer focus on the development of algorithms without having to think about
the whole environment implementation and to facilitate and generalize the
evaluation of these algorithms to make results comparable.
